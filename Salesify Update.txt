# EXPLANATION OF C.L.O.S.E.R.
C - Clarify why they're talking to you. You can't sell anything to someone until you understand what they need www.imarketing,courses

L - Label the problem. Make it tangible. Then confirm with them to make sure you've understood.

O - Overview their problem. What have they tried? What hasn't worked? Diagnose why other solutions haven't worked.

S - Sell the solution. Paint a picture of the destination, the 3 main things that are going to help overcome the problem. Give a sense of how it will be with these solutions in place.

E - Explain concerns. Address objections head-on. Think about objections in terms of removing blame (e.g. Blaming circumstances like Time, Money, Fit; Blaming others like Spouse, Partner, Kids, Employees; Blaming self like Avoiding the decision, Extrapolating past to present). Move the prospect from a position of excuses into a position of action.

Then assume the sale closes and we win.

R - Reinforce the decision. Make them feel good about choosing you.

Give an example of one something like: Personal videos, Handwritten cards, Swag Boxes, Personalized Onboarding, Timely communication within expectations. When you reward people for buying, they respond by sticking around.

Unfortunately I don't have enough context about your product or offer to provide an example of how to apply the C.L.O.S.E.R. framework. The framework involves understanding your potential customers' problems, diagnosing why previous solutions failed, presenting how your productsolves their issues, addressing objections, and reinforcing their decision.

To generate an example, I would need more details on:

    Â· What your product/service is
    . Who your target customers are
    . What problems your product solves for them
    . How your product is unique/better than alternatives

If you provide more specifics about your offer, I can tailor the C.L.O.S.E.R.

apply it. The more details you can give, the more personalized the advice
I can offer. Please let me know if you can share more about your
product/service and customers!
